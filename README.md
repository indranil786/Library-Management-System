# Library-Management-System
This is a simple demonstration of Library Management System.
In this project, I have written only the Admin Panel part.
It is just a simple demonstration and I agree to the fact that the code
could e a lot simpler and could be more efficient, however this is my first try to build
a project, in the near future I hope to improvise it into a better one.

# Storing Of Data
The Books are stored in the form of Individual Files created with their book name.
I have used files which are created/stored in the same directory, as that of the
Python File.(As a replacement for Data Base)

# Services Provided By the Library 
The System can perform the following functions:
1.Add Books to The Library
2.Display details of all the books present in the Library
3.Search a particular Book
4.Borrow a Book
5.Return a Book
6.See the List of Books Borrowed

# Execute the Program
 Go to the Folder inside which the Python File is present and, run the file 
 from an ide , or using command line - python run main . The files for storing the books will be created in the same directory where the     main.py file is present
